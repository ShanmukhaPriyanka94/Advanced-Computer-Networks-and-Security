News Item: “After nearly five decades of research to confirm
their theory, Francois Englert and Peter Higgs were awarded
the Nobel Prize for physics on Tuesday for work that led to
last year's discovery of the Higgs boson. The Nobel Prize
committee named the winners "for the theoretical discovery of
a mechanism that contributed to the understanding of the
origin of mass of subatomic particles," said Staffan Normark,
permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,
at a news conference.”
